# Work In Progress
An Ember CLI blueprint for starting non-application Ember projects. For example, it could be used to develop an Ember wrapper for an external API.

## Usage
Make a local copy of the repo and then specify the blueprint directory when using Ember CLI:
```
> ember new foo --blueprint=/path/to/ember-addon-blueprint/blueprint
```

_Note: The "blueprint" option for Ember CLI was added on 4/26/13._
